#  project :Computer Vision 'Object Tracking with OpenCV'
Objectives:-

1. `Optical Flow`here you can know how it works : https://www.researchgate.net/publication/308808625_Moving_object_tracking_using_optical_flow_and_motion_vector_estimation

2. `Dense Optical Flow`.
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313140603_Dense_optical_flow_in_stabilized_scenes_for_moving_object_detection_from_a_moving_camera


3. `MeanShift`.
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322973311_An_object_tracking_method_based_on_Mean_Shift_algorithm_with_HSV_color_space_and_texture_features

4. `CamShift`.
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274477088_Research_of_CamShift_Algorithm_to_Track_Motion_Objects

5. `Single Object Tracking`.
here you can find some inforfations on how we can track a single object

6. `Multi Object Tracking`.
here you can find some inforfations on how we can track a single object

project realized by :
Badis Sdiri 


github account :
https://github.com/badis7

for more informations : 
you can deploy the CNN architecture in detection and classification of objects 
you can find this on my github account project where i used CIFAR10 like datasets and the CNN arch

you can also deploy GAN if you want to regenerate some tracking face or changing their dimensions and you can also find this on my github account 

*here we use the library openCV 
but we can also use Tensorflow library or keras in detection , tracking and classification


**I hope you try all these simple methodes for tracking ! 
best of luck
